	- The translate program uses a struct table containing a three char
	  table for storing the mappings in an initialize function like that:
		cmap[iso8859-7_number].rep[0-2]
	- The state functions return an enum state.
	- There's a warning in some gcc versions:
		"comparison between pointer and integer"
	  such a comparison is done (with the NULL pointer) to check if some of
	  the .rep[] cells are uninitialized to stop printing of the respective
	  characters.
	- Most of the overall time was spent on the initialization mappings
	  rather than the designing process.
