Kavvadias was born in Nikolsk-Ussuriysky (now Ussuriysk in the Primorsky Krai region of Russia). He believed that this had established a permanent connection between him and the Far East as he wrote in one of his short stories titled "Li".
His parents were Greek, originating from the island of Cefalonia and as a young child he had the opportunity to travel extensively.
His family returned to their island of origin for a few years before finally moving to Pireus, Athens' port, in 1921.He wrote his first poems while in grammar school.
